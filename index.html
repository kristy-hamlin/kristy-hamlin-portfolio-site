                <div class="col2">
                  <p>STARS (Students in Technology, Academia, Research, and Service) is a real organization run by
                    Associate Teaching Professor Dr. Patricia McDermott-Wells at FIU. While STARS runs services
                    dedicated to mentoring and leadership, its most complex offering - and most utilized - is 
                    its tutoring service. Every semester, Dr. Wells spends hundreds of hours manually administrating
                    this program. The purpose of the STARS Admin App is to automate and facilitate as much of this 
                    work as possible. </p>
                    <p>The development of this system began in Spring 2024, and was inherited by my Capstone II group
                      in Summer 2024. I am proud to say that I am the leader of the team. In the video linked below, you 
                      will learn about our work on this project, which uses Microsoft Power Apps. Although the system
                      has not been deployed, we have made significant progress adding functionality.

                  <p>Two of my favorite courses were Machine Learning and AI, in which we learned the theory and equations behind
                    many ML and AI algorithms - from K Nearest Neighbors to MiniMax. In this project, I put my learning into practice
                    by building a Machine Learning model to predict Miami home prices using the Decision Tree Regressor from Sklearn.</p>
                  <p>My model achieved an R-Squared = 0.78, and an MAE on the testing set = $52,000. For comparison, the MAE is small relative
                    to the standard deviation of the data (STD of test set = $193,000), meaning the prediction is fairly accurate given such 
                    variable data. This is sensible, seeing as real estate applications have a high level of noise.</p>
